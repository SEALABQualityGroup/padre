 * A PropertyAccessRecorder can be attached to an {@link IEolContext}

 * value from a model element. For example, execution of the EOL code:
 * `Person.all.first.name` would result in a PropertyAccessRecorder
 * being notified of a property access for the `name` property of 
 * the `Person.all.first` model element.
 * 
 * Recording is separated into sessions. A session is started using
 * {@link #startRecording()} and ended with {@link #stopRecording()}.
 * Property accesses for the most recently started session are available
 * from {@link #getPropertyAccesses()}. Clients that wish to access 
 * property accesses from earlier recording sessions are expected to 
 * call {@link #getPropertyAccesses()} and store the resulting value 
 * before calling {@link #startRecording()}.
